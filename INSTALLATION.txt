VOTING APPLICATION DEMO INSTALLATION PROCESS.

This application requires laravel 4,
apache, mysql, and PHP with the Mcrypt extension installed.

1.	Unzip the applications content to folder of your choice;
	or you can run git clone git@github.com:dotthis/VotingSystem.git foldername from a 
	terminal.
	
2.	Once the files are in place to need to allow write access to the applications storage 
	folders. To do this type
		
		(sudo) chmod -R 777 app/storage/
	
3.	you may need to create a mysql user with database and user creation permissions and 
	the ability to grant permissions for this next bit, you also need to make sure you run
	the following commands from the root of the application.

4.	Run the 'createdatabase.sql' file located in the root of the applications file tree, 	
	either by:
	
		a) using the source command within MySql:
			
			source path/to/file/createdatabase.sql
			
		b) or by using the terminal:
			
			cat createdatabase.sql | mysql -u{your username} -p{your password}
		
5.	Once this has been run you need to build the tables and populate them with data so
	exit MySql, and from the terminal run:
		
		php artisan migrate (this command will create the tables)
		
	and when that has completed run:
		
		php artisan db:seed (this command will populate the tables with mock data)
		
6.	Assuming all went well you should have managed to set up the application and its mock 
	data. 
	
	Now we need to configure the server
	
7. 	in your server configuration file you may need to add something similar to the 
	following block to get the server to run the site locally.

	<Directory "/path/to/applications/base/directory">
		Options All
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Directory>

	NameVirtualHost *:80
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName www.votingapp.co.uk
		DocumentRoot /path/to/application/root/public
	</VirtualHost>

	You'll notice that the DocumentRoot is set to the 'public' folder and not the 
	applications root directory.

7.	open your hosts file (usually /etc/hosts) add the following line to the end of the 
	file

		127.0.0.1 www.votingapp.co.uk
	
	and then save

8.	Once the above steps are complete, restart apache (sudo apachectl restart)

9.	In a web browser, go to, www.votingapp.co.uk and you should be greeted with my 
	application.
